     hartree contribution      =       7.57318490 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -31.82154249 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -71.95438538 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =    -682.34650966 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00046953 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  18 iterations
