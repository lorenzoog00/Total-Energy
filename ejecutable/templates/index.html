        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on the application of Density Functional Theory (DFT), a quantum mechanical modeling method used to investigate the electronic structure of many-body systems, particularly atoms, molecules, and the condensed phases. Utilizing Quantum Espresso, an open-source software suite for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale based on DFT, this paper presents the development of a predictive calculator. The calculator, based on neural networks, estimates the total energy of crystalline systems modeled using Quantum Espresso. It predicts the total energy of a given system based on specific input parameters: the element, the utilized pseudopotential, the k points, and the cutoff value for the kinetic energy of plane waves (ecut). This approach allows for efficient exploration of the parameter space and identification of optimal configurations for more detailed investigations, significantly reducing the time and computational resources required.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In this study, a successful predictive model was developed using neural networks to predict the total energy of crystalline systems with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1829. The model involves a wide set of seven elements, several pseudopotentials (four for each element), a k-point grid from 1x1x1 up to 12x12x12, and an energy cut (ecut) in a range from 0 to 110 Ry. The wide scope shows how capable a model is to work in a parameter space that counts many, varied, and diverse scenarios for computational chemistry.
            
            In this recommendation, for those applications with a need for preciseness in energy calculations, the use of such tools as Quantum ESPRESSO or any other DFT-based software still stands. This model offers a viable, resourceful alternative for preliminary assessment or scenarios where an order of magnitude on an approximate energy value suffices.
            
            It is, of course, computationally costly, extending this database to a larger set of elements and pseudopotentials, but it is the present limitation of the model. While this gives a model to work with, the relatively high mean absolute error against direct DFT calculations points a direction to refine. So, improving the accuracy of this model becomes paramount if it is ever to furnish a tool with which researchers can depend for preliminary energy estimations in material science research.
            
            Future work will focus on the dataset's expansion to encompass a more comprehensive range of elements and pseudopotentials, hence broadening its applicability and allowing the model to make better predictions. Further research should also make the training process and algorithmic efficiency more refined to reduce the MAE closer to the precision by traditional DFT methods..</p>
